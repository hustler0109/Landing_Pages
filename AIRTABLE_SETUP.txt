Airtable connection (Node.js + .env — secure)
=============================================

Forms submit to a Node.js server, which writes to Airtable. Your Airtable
token lives only in a .env file (already in .gitignore), so it is never
sent to the browser.

What you need to do
-------------------
1. Create an Airtable base with a table named "Leads" and columns:
   Name, Business Name, Email, WhatsApp Number, Your Role, Business Type,
   Number of Locations, Monthly Revenue, Which Level Interests You?, Source
   (see the plan doc for field types).

2. Get your Base ID and Personal Access Token:
   - Base ID: open your base → Help → API documentation (or airtable.com/api).
   - Token: airtable.com/create/tokens → Create token, scopes data.records:read
     and data.records:write, access to this base only.

3. Copy env.example to .env (in the project root):
     cp env.example .env
   Edit .env and set:
     AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
     AIRTABLE_TOKEN=patXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxx
   Optionally set PORT=3000 and AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=Leads.

4. Install and run the server:
     npm install
     npm start
   Open e.g. http://localhost:3000/Clinic/clinic_landing.html and submit a form.
   Data goes: browser → Node server (reads .env) → Airtable. Set up Airtable
   Automations for email and Zapier/Make for WhatsApp (trigger: new record in Leads).
